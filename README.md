# Customizable Chrome-extension-to-modify-hyperlinks-and-cookie-capture

OVERVIEW

This Chromium browser extension can replace any given hyperlink of a webpage with another through just its keyword. It can also capture user's cookies for any website like Gmail etc. The captured cookies are then sent to any ip address of user's choice. The extension does so with least amount of permission requests to user, thus making it thoroughly oblivious to the user.

The project aims to merely observe the authentication security mechanisms of a browser and the invasive powers of a browser extension
